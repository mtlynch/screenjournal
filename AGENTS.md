# Go

## Defining symbols

- Define variables and structs as close as possible to when they're first used.
  - Exception: Declare all package-level variables and structs at the top of the file above imports.
- Name helper functions with an explicit verb, e.g. `mustCreateUser` instead of `mustNewUser`.

## Formatting

- Run `gofmt -s -w` on new or modified `.go` files before committing.

## Error handling

- In `fmt.Errorf` wrappers, describe the failed operation with `failed to <verb>` instead of gerund phrases like `parsing <thing>`.

## Interfaces

- Define interfaces in the client package that consumes them, not in the package that implements them.
  - This follows the Go convention that clients should define interfaces based on what they need.
  - Implementing packages should return concrete types.

## Parse, don't validate

- Represent data constrained by business rules with a type that prevents invalid states rather than repeatedly validating primitives.
  - Give the type an unexported primitive field, construct it through a validating constructor, and expose an accessor for the validated value.
  - Apply this especially to user-supplied data.

For example:

```go
type HashKey struct {
	value string
}

func NewHashKey(raw string) (HashKey, error) {
	if utf8.RuneCountInString(raw) != 5 {
		return HashKey{}, fmt.Errorf("hash key has incorrect length")
	}
	return HashKey{value: raw}, nil
}

func (h HashKey) String() string {
	return h.value
}
```

## HTTP handlers

- Always parse user-supplied HTTP data into a typed request value with a dedicated parse function. This preserves the data's provenance.
- Convert every user-supplied request value into a named, validated type before passing it through the application.

For example:

```go
type mediaCaptionPutRequest struct {
	MediaID app.MediaID
	Caption app.Caption
}

func parseMediaCaptionPutRequest(r *http.Request) (mediaCaptionPutRequest, error) {
	id, err := parseMediaIDFromPathValue(r, "id")
	if err != nil {
		return mediaCaptionPutRequest{}, err
	}

	if err := r.ParseForm(); err != nil {
		return mediaCaptionPutRequest{}, err
	}

	caption, err := app.NewCaption(r.FormValue("caption"))
	if err != nil {
		return mediaCaptionPutRequest{}, err
	}

	return mediaCaptionPutRequest{
		MediaID: id,
		Caption: caption,
	}, nil
}
```

## Go modules

- Do not vendor Go modules locally (`go mod vendor`).
- Use Nix `vendorHash` in `flake.nix` for reproducible builds instead.
- When dependencies change, update `vendorHash` by running `nix build` with a fake hash and using the correct hash from the error message.

## Go testing

- When writing new test cases, avoid having `t.Run` have special-case behavior for particular inputs.
  - Instead, use general purpose logic that doesn't assume particular inputs
- Design test table fields to describe the scenario at a high level (e.g., `priorResetsForUser int`) rather than exposing raw data structures the reader must mentally reconstruct (e.g., `recordedEvents []recordedEvent`). A reader should understand the test behavior from the table alone, before reading the test body.
- An `explanation` should state its condition and expected outcome.
  - Good: `"books with empty titles should return an error"`
  - Bad: `"empty title"`
  - Good: `"books with special characters in title should succeed"`
  - Bad: `"special characters"`
- Never use `time.Now` in tests. Use a hardcoded fixed time
- When tests need time to progress, reassign one shared `now` variable in chronological order rather than using inline `now.Add(...)` values. Do not move test time backwards.
- Inject `time.Now` as a `func() time.Time` dependency so production code is testable.
  - If a type already injects a clock for one purpose, use that same clock for all time-dependent logic in that type.
- Go tests should be in a separate `_tests` package so they don't test non-exported interfaces
- Test HTTP handlers by sending requests to the relevant routes.
  - Minimize test coupling by avoiding tests that call HTTP handler functions directly
- When a Go test performs multiple HTTP requests in one flow, keep shared fixture setup at the top of the test and isolate each request in its own lexical scope.

  - Share state between request blocks explicitly through variables such as cookies or IDs.
  - Example pattern:

    ```go
    server := newTestServer(t)

    var sessionCookie *http.Cookie
    {
      req := httptest.NewRequest(http.MethodPost, "/login", http.NoBody)
      rr := httptest.NewRecorder()

      server.Router().ServeHTTP(rr, req)

      cookies := rr.Result().Cookies()
      if got, want := len(cookies), 1; got != want {
        t.Fatalf("cookie count=%d, want=%d", got, want)
      }
      sessionCookie = cookies[0]
    }

    {
      req := httptest.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, "/account", nil)
      req.AddCookie(sessionCookie)
      rr := httptest.NewRecorder()

      server.Router().ServeHTTP(rr, req)

      if got, want := rr.Code, http.StatusOK; got != want {
        t.Fatalf("status=%d, want=%d", got, want)
      }
    }
    ```

- Use `t.Fatalf` for assertions where the test cannot continue if the assertion fails.
  - Typically, we fail with `t.Fatalf` if a function returned an error when we expected a nil error.
  - If we're just testing that the ouput of a function is what we expect, that's a `t.Errorf` not a `t.Fatalf`.
- Do not write tests that scrape information from `log.Print*` calls.
- Test domain-value validation in the package that defines the typed value, not only through HTTP handler tests.

### if got, want

Use the `if got, want` pattern when writing or editing unit tests. See this snippet as an example:

```go
func TestParseTwitterHandle(t *testing.T) {
  for _, tt := range []struct {
    explanation    string
    input          string
    handleExpected social.TwitterHandle
    errExpected    error
  }{
    {
      "regular handle on its own is valid",
      "jerry",
      social.TwitterHandle("jerry"),
      nil,
    },
    {
      "regular handle in URL is valid",
      "https://twitter.com/jerry",
      social.TwitterHandle("jerry"),
      nil,
    },
    {
      "handle with exactly 15 characters is valid",
      "https://twitter.com/" + strings.Repeat("A", 15),
      social.TwitterHandle(strings.Repeat("A", 15)),
      nil,
    },
    {
      "handle with more than 15 characters is invalid",
      "https://twitter.com/" + strings.Repeat("A", 16),
      social.TwitterHandle(""),
      social.ErrInvalidTwitterHandle,
    },
  } {
    t.Run(fmt.Sprintf("%s [%s]", tt.explanation, tt.input), func(t *testing.T) {
      handle, err := social.ParseTwitterHandle(tt.input)
      if got, want := err, tt.errExpected; got != want {
        t.Fatalf("err=%v, want=%v", got, want)
      }
      if got, want := handle, tt.handleExpected; got != want {
        t.Errorf("handle=%v, want=%v", got, want)
      }
    })
  }
}
```

### Table-driven tests

- The ordering of fields in `TestParseTwitterHandle` is intentional. It goes:
  - Human-facing explanation of what the test is asserting
  - Input(s) to the function under test
  - Output(s) to the function under test
- Use an `explanation string` field as the first field in table-driven test cases.
- When testing HTTP handlers, place the expected HTTP status first among the outputs.

# Callsite legibility

Function calls should be legible from the callsite:

Here's an illegible function call

```go
foo(3, 'foo', 9.2)
```

The call is illegible because it's impossible to infer from the callsite what the parameters mean.

Here are more legible callsites:

```go
angle := 3
rocketName := 'foo'
power := 9.2
foo(angle, rocketName, power)
```

Or change the callee to accept a struct:

```go
	foo(LaunchParams{
		Angle:      3,
		RocketName: "foo",
		Power:      9.2,
	})
```

Dave Cheney's functional options pattern is also a more legible alternative:

```go
func (s Store) ReadReviews(opts ...store.ReadReviewsOption) { ... }

...

s.ReadReviews(
    store.FilterByUsername(user),
    store.FilterByMovieID(id),
)
```

# API design

## Simplicity

- Keep shell scripts and Nix apps as simple as possible.
- Do not add more than one method for achieving the same outcome.
  - If we replace one script or workflow with a better one, do not keep the old one around for legacy purposes or backwards compatibility.
  - Upgrade all references to use the new path.
- Do not add extra flags to support hypothetical scenarios.
- Do not add experimental modes, compatibility shims, aliases, workarounds, or fallback paths.
  - For code we own, prefer a single path that we know works and fix that path when it fails.
- YAGNI.
  - Do not add flags or options until there is a specific need.

## Minimize exported surface area

- Don't export methods just for testing - test through public APIs instead.
- Only export what external packages actually need to use.

## Avoid platform coupling

- Don't pass platform-specific types (e.g., AWS Lambda events) to business logic.
- Create simple structs with only the data needed, making code portable.

## Encapsulate related operations

- Group related operations (e.g., verification + processing) in a single method.
- This simplifies APIs and prevents steps from being accidentally skipped.

## HTTP errors

- Include the failed operation and underlying error in user-facing HTTP error messages instead of generic messages like `Internal Server Error`.
  - No: `http.Error(w, "Internal Server Error", http.StatusInternalServerError)`
  - Yes: `http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Failed to retrieve reactions: %v", err), http.StatusInternalServerError)`
- Keep the contextual server-side log call alongside the corresponding `http.Error` call so both contain the same context.

## Design for testing

- Consider allowing bypass mechanisms for tests (e.g., empty secret = skip verification).
- Test private methods indirectly through public APIs.
- Structure code so unit tests don't need complex setup (e.g., generating valid signatures).

## Keep interfaces simple

- Group related parameters into structs rather than multiple arguments.
- Return single error types that can represent multiple failure modes.
- One method should have one clear responsibility from the caller's perspective.

## Avoid redundant naming in interface methods

- Method names should not repeat the domain implied by the interface or type name.
- Read the method at its callsite (`s.field.Method()`) to check for redundancy.
- Prefer names like `PasswordResetter.Request(user)` over `PasswordResetter.RequestReset(user)`.

# Assistant guidelines

- Do not ask the user to run a command/test or read an output file that you can read yourself.
  - Aim as much as possible to absorb work from the user.

## Documenting lessons learned

After successfully completing a task where the user had to provide corrections or guidance, consider adding the lessons to `AGENTS.md`. This helps build institutional knowledge and prevents repeating mistakes.

### When to add new guidelines

- The user corrected a misunderstanding about the codebase
- You learned a new pattern or best practice specific to this project
- The user revealed a preference or requirement not previously documented

### How to add guidelines

1. Identify the key principle or pattern learned
2. Determine which section of `AGENTS.md` fits best
3. Add a concise, actionable guideline
4. Keep entries brief but clear for future LLM conversations

### Example

If you learned that methods shouldn't be exported just for testing, add to `AGENTS.md`:

"Don't export methods just for testing - test through public APIs instead."

# Nix flake

- Do not embed scripts in Nix files when the script is longer than 15 lines of code.
  - Keep scripts as standalone files and call them from the flake.
- Avoid string substitution to inject large shell scripts into the flake.
- When communicating executable locations from the flake to shell scripts, prefer updating `PATH` so scripts can execute binaries by name.

# pnpm modules

- When dependencies change, update `pnpmDepsHash` by running `nix build` with a fake hash and using the correct hash from the error message.
- Depend on exact versions of npm packages rather than package minimums.
  - Imprecise versions create discrepancies between pnpm and flake.nix, especially for playwright.

# dev-scripts

- In general, prefer to test with `nix build` commands rather than `dev-scripts` scripts because the `nix build` commands leverage caching better.
- Do not depend on Nix in the `dev-scripts`.
  - Nix build targets should leverage scripts from `dev-scripts` rather than reimplementing the same logic in Nix.

# Style conventions

- End comments with trailing punctuation.
- Break code comment lines at 80 characters.
  - Treat tabs as two spaces.
- Do not make assumptions about external clients or deployment environments in code comments unless they impose a relevant design constraint.
  - Incorrect: `// StoreUser stores user information that comes from the web interface when deployed on Fly.io.`
  - Correct: `// StoreUser persists a User object in the SQLite database.`
  - Exception: `// RetryConnection works around a bug in Fly.io where the first connection always fails.`
- Never keep dead code for the sake of backwards compatibility.
  - If there are no calls to a function or uses of a type/variable outside of test code, it is dead code and should be deleted.
- Never log PII (e.g., email addresses) in server log messages.

## Markdown

- Do not hard wrap Markdown text outside code snippets.
- Generally, prefer bulleted lists to tables.

# Shell scripts

- Attempt to break bash lines at 80 characters, but don't layer in complexity to fit within 80 characters.
  - e.g., if a long URL forces the line beyond 80 characters, it's better to just have the long line than to break up the URL into parts that are below 80 characters to fit the limit.
- Prefer passing information to shell scripts through command-line arguments rather than environment variables.
  - This applies to `dev-scripts/` interfaces. Application runtime configuration may use environment variables when that is the intended interface.
- When removing a command-line argument, delete it cleanly.
  - Do not add compatibility checks for the old interface.

### Headings

- Use sentence casing and not title casing.
- Do not add trailing periods.

## JavaScript

- Prefer htmx for UI flows when it reduces custom JavaScript code.
- Do not use `alert()` or `confirm()`.
  - Use `window.dialogManager.alert()` and `window.dialogManager.confirm()` instead.
  - For htmx, use `hx-confirm` which hooks into the custom dialog automatically.
- Do not embed Go template conditionals inside JavaScript. Instead, render a data attribute or hidden input in HTML and read it from JS.

# Testing

- To run Go unit tests, run `nix build .#go-tests`
- Do not write to the filesystem in tests.
  - Design production interfaces around file readers or filesystem interfaces rather than the local filesystem.
- Avoid testing implementation-dependent call counts when you can assert a more meaningful signal that is part of the function contract.
- When writing tests to verify a bugfix, follow TDD conventions: write the test with the failing test first, verify the test fails, fix the bug, and verify that the test passes.

## Tests must be correct by inspection

- Minimize complexity and abstraction in tests, as indirection makes it harder to verify correctness by simple inspection.
- Avoid loops except for standard table-driven tests in Go.
- Don't use helper functions that hide information needed to understand a test's correctness.
  - Helper functions in tests are okay as long as they don't hide critical values.
- If we use table-driven tests, one table per function.

### Example: Bad test

```python
def setUp(self):
  database = MockDatabase()
  database.add_row({
      'username': 'joe123',
      'score': 150.0
    })
  self.account_manager = AccountManager(database)

def test_initial_score(self):
  initial_score = self.account_manager.get_score(username='joe123')
  self.assertEqual(150.0, initial_score)
```

This is an example of a bad test because the reader can't reason from `test_initial_score` why the assertion is correct. They'd have to go outside the test function to see the value of 150.0.

### Example: Good test with helper method

Helper methods in tests are okay as long as they don't hide critical values:

```python
def make_dummy_account(self, username, score):
  return Account(username=username,
                 name='Dummy User',         # <- OK: Buries values but they're
                 email='dummy@example.com', # <-     irrelevant to the test
                 score=score)

def test_increase_score(self):
  account_manager = AccountManager()
  account_manager.add_account(
    make_dummy_account(
      username='joe123',  # <- GOOD: Relevant values stay
      score=150.0))       # <-       in the test

  account_manager.adjust_score(username='joe123',
                               adjustment=25.0)

  self.assertEqual(175.0,
                   account_manager.get_score(username='joe123'))
```

## Playwright tests

### Test realistic user flows

- Playwright tests should begin with the user landing on the root route and navigating to different app pages by clicking page elements.

  - The tests should not simulate the user navigating the app by changing the URL manually.
  - The tests should assert that the URL has changed at times when we expect a URL change, but the app should cause the change, not the tests.

- Run end-to-end tests with `nix build .#e2e-tests`.
  - Do not run Playwright directly unless the user explicitly asks for that workflow.

### Test user-visible behavior

- Test what end users see and interact with, not implementation details.
- Avoid assertions based on internal function names, CSS class names, or data structures.

### Test isolation

- Each test should be fully independent: its own local storage, session storage, cookies, and data.
- Use `beforeEach` hooks for shared setup (e.g., navigation, login) rather than sharing state across tests.

### Use locators

- Prefer user-facing locators in this order: role, text, test ID.
  - `page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })`
  - `page.getByText('Welcome')`
  - `page.getByTestId('submit-btn')`
- Avoid CSS selectors and XPath — the DOM changes frequently and they couple tests to implementation.
- Narrow locators to a specific section of the page using chaining and filtering:
  ```ts
  await page
    .getByRole("listitem")
    .filter({ hasText: "Product 2" })
    .getByRole("button", { name: "Add to cart" })
    .click();
  ```

### Use web-first assertions

- Use `expect(locator).toBeVisible()` and similar web-first assertions — they auto-wait for conditions to be met.
- Do not use `expect(await locator.isVisible()).toBe(true)` — `isVisible()` resolves immediately without waiting.

### Parallelism

- Playwright runs test files in parallel by default — keep tests independent to take full advantage of this.
- For many independent tests within a single file, enable parallel mode explicitly:
  ```ts
  test.describe.configure({ mode: "parallel" });
  ```

# Documentation

- Use active voice in documentation.
  - Prefer clear `<subject> <verb> <object>` structure.
  - Especially avoid passive voice phrasing that obscures which component performs which action (e.g., "the token **is passed**").

# Git

## Pre-commit checks

- If git pre-commit hooks fail, pause and fix the failures.
- Do not ignore pre-commit failures.
- Never bypass hooks with `--no-verify`.

## Commit message conventions

- Always write commit messages with single-quoted heredocs so bash characters do not interpolate within the message.
- Make the first line describe the effect of the change, not the implementation details.
- Put the most important information first so reviewers can quickly understand the change.
- Use the body to explain motivation, user or client impact, and relevant background.
- Include searchable details such as exact error messages when they aid future debugging.
- Include relevant breaking changes, dependency rationale, and issue or commit references. Summarize linked bugs and references in the commit message; do not rely on links alone.
- When the diff is not self-evident, include validation instructions or known testing limitations.
- Use clear section headings for long messages.
- Leave out details that are obvious from the diff, such as file lists and mechanical implementation walkthroughs.
- Keep short-term review chatter, preview URLs, and ephemeral build artifacts out of commit messages.
- Do not bury critical maintenance constraints in commit messages.
  - Enforce them in code, tests, or docs.

## Remotes

- Do not attempt to push, pull, or fetch from remotes unless the user instructs you to do so directly.
  - You do not have access to any private git repos, so most attempts will fail.
